### Books
I am illiterate. From 2010-2022, I did not read a single book. Here are the books I have read since then, in order of recency. My favourite book is __Le Petit Prince__

#### 2024
- [Le Petit Prince](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Little_Prince/CQYg20lTHtMC?hl=en)
  - hardcover
  - review: my favourite book i have ever read. i almost cried reading this book. i'm not sure how i would understand this book as a child. _but the eyes are blind. one must look with the heart_
- [Red Notice](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Red_Notice/8kxrBgAAQBAJ?hl=en)
  - ebook
  - review: my attention span is improving. at times, i could not put this ebook down. browder is a fantastic storyteller, but a poor writer. i want to read this der spiegel article, which casts doubt on browder's account: https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-case-of-sergei-magnitsky-anti-corruption-champion-or-corrupt-anti-hero-a-1297796.html
- [Central Banking 101](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Central_Banking_101/nwoozgEACAAJ?hl=en)
  - ebook 
  - review: a good, up-to-date overview of central banks and the levers they pull, though quite dry. central banking is poorly understood, despite its increasing importance. biggest takeaway: loans create deposits. here's a paper that expands on the concept: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf
