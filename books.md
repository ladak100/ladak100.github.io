### Books
I am illiterate. From 2010-2022, I did not read a single book. Here are the books I have read since then, in order of recency. My favourite book is __Le Petit Prince__

#### 2024
- [The Airman's Odyssey](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Airman_s_Odyssey/nIOZdLHReUMC?hl=en)
  - __hardcover__
  - __WITHDREW:__ this book bored me to death. i couldnt deal with waxing poetic for 500 pages. his other book, le petit prince, is amazing, but i lack the iq and attention span to finish this one. i couldnt keep my focus - i kept getting distracted by this girl on the bus
- [Le Petit Prince](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Little_Prince/CQYg20lTHtMC?hl=en)
  - __hardcover__
  - __review:__ my favourite book i have ever read. i almost cried reading this book. i'm not sure how i would understand this book as a child. 
  - __nice quote:__ _it is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye._
- [Red Notice](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Red_Notice/8kxrBgAAQBAJ?hl=en)
  - __ebook__
  - __review:__ my attention span is improving. at times, i could not put this ebook down. browder is a fantastic storyteller, but a poor writer. i want to read this der spiegel article, which casts doubt on browder's account: https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-case-of-sergei-magnitsky-anti-corruption-champion-or-corrupt-anti-hero-a-1297796.html
- [Central Banking 101](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Central_Banking_101/nwoozgEACAAJ?hl=en)
  - __ebook__ 
  - __review:__ a good, up-to-date overview of central banks and the levers they pull, though quite dry. central banking is poorly understood, despite its increasing importance. loans create deposits. here's a paper that expands on the concept: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf
