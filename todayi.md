### Today, I...
#### April 2024
Tuesday April 16th, 2024
Today, I felt really down. despite it being a beautiful day. despite the cherry blossoms in full bloom at robarts. despite that i woke up early. despite that i took my dog for a walk. despite that i bumped into my uncle and cousin. what have i done? what have i done? what have i done? what have i done? what have i done? what have i done? 
anger beats sadness. sadness beats happiness. happiness beats anger.
by the afternoon, i had a hop in my step. used delusions, like helium balloons, to get out of the rut. the balloons popped after talking to a friend at night
did i make a mistake moving countries? away from friends and family?
then why do i feel so sad now that im back in toronto for a month?
im closer than ever with family, hanging out with friends more than ever, breaking boundaries more than ever,and yet i feel like theyre all drifting away faster than ever
maybe i need to get used to being alone again, doing things muself again
